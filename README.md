# Pasiphae

## Overview

Pasiphae is a music library manager which allows users to organize, rate and share their music among their friends. It allows them also to follow closely to their favorite artists, create playlists, get always updated about the new releases and organize their music collections. 

At the early stage of the project the basic concept is being designed. A tool is free to use for everyone.

## Main Features

The goal of the project is to provide users with ability to organize their favorite music into personalized collections, rate the music which they have recently listened to and always stay updated about the newest releases. This chapter briefly describes the main features of Pasiphae.

### Rate your music

With pasiphae it will be easy to rate the music, which has just been played with user's favorite music player. Integration with popular streaming services, such as Spotify, Tidal, Apple Music or Deezer is expected. Also it is the user, who defines the precision of music rating while creating rankings. Therefore it is possible to introduce a detailed level of music comparison.

System also shows albums, which have similar ratings given by the user. Afterwards can be decided, whether the rating is correct or is worth changing.
